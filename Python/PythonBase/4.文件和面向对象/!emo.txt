While The Python Language Reference describes the exact syntax 
and semantics of the Python language, this library reference 
manual describes the standard library that is distributed with Python.
It also describes some of the optional components that are commonly 
included in Python distributions.Pythonâ€™s standard library is very 
extensive, offering a wide range of facilities as indicated by the
 long table of contents listed below. The library contains built-in
 modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality 
  such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python
   programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide 
   standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday
    programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to
     encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by 
     abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.
The Python installers for the Windows platform usually include the 
entire standard library and often also include many additional 
components. For Unix-like operating systems Python is normally 
provided as a collection of packages, so it may be necessary to 
use the packaging tools provided with the operating system to obtain 
some or all of the optional components.In addition to the standard 
library, there is a growing collection of several thousand components 
(from individual programs and modules to packages and entire application 
development frameworks), available from the Python Package Index.
