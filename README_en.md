# Bioinfo Struggle Way

*Read this in other languages: [English](README_en.md), [简体中文](README.md).*

## Description

This is a way to fight against bioinformation. The project mainly records how I started to learn bioinformation and study further from a freshman. Through writing down my struggle study experience, I hope that I am able to explore the wonderful genetic world with all of you and make friends with the students who want to get admission to bioinformatics.

This project will update according to the request of post-graduate entrance examination(UCAS and HZAU are referenced), including four aspect, the fundamental theory of bioinformation, mathematics, R and Python. Due to the limitation of vigor, the update may delay. If you have any problem, please contact with me via issues and email.

Here are some request of some research institutions and high school in China.

## About

I am a student from HUNAU. Just like most students in high school, I am perplexed to know what could I do in the variable world. I am not interested in what I majored in so that I always distract from the teacher.

I got to know bioinformation since the first year of my college and found that I gradually lost the passion because the only way I have is the Google and Bing when I am confused. What`s more, the knowledge is so complicated that most of us easily give up. So, I started to write down what I experienced and hope it is helpful to you.

## Update 

### Update Plan

I plan to share my learning progress such as the practice code and the source of bioinformation I have gathered to help those people who need in the earlier stage. And then, I will share something about bioinformation in action, such as the fundamental of bioinformation and mathematics and the analysis of bioinformation. For the detail, you can think and talk me!
